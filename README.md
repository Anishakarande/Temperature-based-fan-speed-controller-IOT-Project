# Temperature-based-fan-speed-controller-IOT-Project
This project is a smart automation system that adjusts the speed of a fan based on the surrounding temperature. Using a temperature sensor and microcontroller, it reads real-time data and controls the fan speed accordingly through PWM signals. Designed for energy-efficient environments, this solution is ideal for smart homes, classrooms, or any space where climate-responsive control is needed.
OBJECTIVES: 
1.	Interface a temperature-controlled fan with ESP8266 NodeMCU. 
2.	Monitor and control the fan based on DHT11 temperature readings. 
3.	Visualize data and control the fan remotely via Blynk IoT. 
MATERIALS REQUIRED: 
ESP8266 NodeMCU board 
Motor driver (L298N) 
DHT11 sensor 
AC Fan 
Breadboard 
Jumper wires 
USB cable 
Computer with Arduino IDE 
Blynk app installed on smartphone/tablet
